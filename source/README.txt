This is libgcm V0.1a, an early alpha of my library for
manipulating gamecube master files. It currently has
little functionality, but you can list and extract the contents
of GCMs - the only thing I haven't got extracting correctly
yet is the apploader stuff, because I haven't even really
begun working on that yet, and don't know how to really test
the results of that extraction.

	Before this is over, I intend to have the library
ready to insert, append, and create entire new images for
burning to a GCM. My final test of this ability will be to
completely unpack a disc image onto the drive (which it can
already do, with the exception of the apploader) and re-pack
it and see if it plays.

	Maybe someone will be helped by this code. GPL applies.
This code is free as in freedom. If you have any additions you
would like to see in the next release, I'd be happy to include them,
with credit. Just email them to me or find me in #gcdev on EFNet.

	Enjoy!
